Hi, I'm Jacob Hanson-Regalado. I am a freshman studying Computer Science at Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill, California. I have a passion for innovation and technology, and I have a thirst for knowledge. I am always expanding my skills and exploring new interests. More of my experience in Computer Science outside of the classroom has been web-development, but I am also interested in exploring other more advanced subjects like Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. I also enjoy reading, eating, hanging out with my girlfriend, and playing spike ball with my friends. I hope you enjoy my site!
