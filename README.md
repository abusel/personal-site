# My Personal Website
This single-page application was built using React to showcase my portfolio and experiences.

This is currently V2 of the site, with V1 available under the 'old-site' branch. Any and all feedback on the website is welcome! I am always trying to find new ways to improve it and V3 is in the works.

# To Run The Website Locally
Clone the repository into your local machine, then within the website/ folder run:
```python
npm install
npm start
```

# New Features
- [ ] Turn skills list into a skill tree like in video games. Could be a graph with moving nodes like the landing page and then nodes are expanded on hover to show the skill and a possible game-like rating, e.g. 'Novice', 'Intermediate', 'Expert', etc... 
- [ ] Categorize projects and create interesting new way to see them.
- [ ] Compact Experience page in some way.
